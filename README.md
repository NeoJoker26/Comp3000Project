# Comp3000Project
# Banana Quality CRUD Application

This is my Comp 3000 project where I use tkinter to visualise a file and then let the user put it through postgreSQL and SQLAlchemy.

## Features (Concept)

- **Create:** Users can add new entries for banana quality attributes such as size, weight, sweetness, softness, harvest time, ripeness, acidity, and overall quality.
- **Read:** Users can view existing banana quality entries by entering the ID of the banana.
- **Update:** Not yet implemented.
- **Delete:** Not yet implemented.
- **Visualize:** Users can visualize the data stored in the database, currently displaying all entries.

## Dependencies

- Python 3+
- Tkinter 
- SQLAlchemy
- psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL database interaction)
